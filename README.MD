## Data Engineering
Data engineering is divided into two parts.
- Create physical data tables.
  - Specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
  - For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite key, which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
  - Create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
- Import data from CSV file 
  - Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. Make sure to import the data in correct order to handle the foreign keys.
